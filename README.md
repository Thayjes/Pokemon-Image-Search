# Pokemon-Image-Search

This contains code and images for creating an Image Search Engine for Pokemon.
151 images of Pokemon were collected and indexed using a Zernike Moments Shape Descriptor.
A find screen Python script was written for extracting the Pokemon from a query image of a Game Boy containing the Pokemon.
Finally the processed query image, was compared against the indexed database using a Euclidean Score.
The scores were sorted and the closest Pokemon match was displayed on the screen.
